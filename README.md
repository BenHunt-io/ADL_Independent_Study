# Activities of Daily Living - [First Person Activity Recognition Independent Study Texas State University] 

### Overview
This repository is a compilation of programs to do video processing, particularly on the ADL (Activites of Daily Living) dataset from 2012 to work with the Kinetics Dataset. The ADL dataset consists of 1 million frames of unscripted morning activity in the 1st person point of view. This data is raw and not processed for other datasets. Kinetics-i3D is a state of the art 3rd person activity recongition model from 2017 trained on a much larger dataset. Kinetics-i3D achieves a much higher classification accuracy than what the ADL model reports.
